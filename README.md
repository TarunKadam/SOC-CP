I am doing Project ID-22: Competitive Programming under Himanshu as mentor. He provided us with a sheet of resources and Qs per week which I followed. Also, I learnt and practiced few extra
questions too from Strivers A2Z DSA Course sheet. My week wise learning is as follows:
Week 1:
  1. Time and Space Complexity: I learned its concept and went through these complexities for standard algorithms like loops, sorting, searching etc.
  2. Arrays: I mainly practiced Qs trying to improve my problem solving skills, getting exposed to uniquee algorithms too through special questions.
  3. Sorting: I learnt and implemented bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort and selection sort.
  4. Binary Search: I practiced it through Qs pertaining to searching and special type of qs like finding factorial of big numbers.
  5. Two Pointers: Learned its concept and implementation through Qs.

Week 2:
  1. Strings: Practiced Qs provided by mentor.
  2. Recursion: Learned concepts and practiced a bit.

Week 3:
  1. Linked Lists: Understood the various types of linked lists, basic operations on them and practiced their questions.
  2. Pointers: Have enough prior knowledge learnt in CS101.
  3.  I practiced some array qs too.

Week 4:
  1. Stack and Queue: Learnt what it is about and various operations and types too using the resources provided by mentor. Couldnt practice questions. I just knew the LIFO and FIFO principles
                      only before SOC.
  2. Bit Manipulation: Had a decent idea before SOC due to CS101. Learnt about different bit manipulations for various operations. I used https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/bit-manipulation.html
                       resource provided by my mentor and also other resources provided. I practiced questions given by mentor.
